## Introduction
These are a few git commands that I refer to from time to time when I need a reminder. This is by no means a comprehensive guide on how to use git.

2. [Branching with Git](#branching-with-git)
3. [Keep a fork up to date](#keep-a-fork-up-to-date)
4. [Squash commits already pushed to GitHub](#squash-commits-already-pushed-to-github)
5. [Set the date of the last commit](#set-the-date-of-the-last-commit)

----
## Add co-authors to a commit
This will allow you to give credit to more than one author for a commit. This works on GitHub only, and count towards the contribution history of all authors.

Within the commit message add "Co-authored-by:" followed by the name and GitHub email of the individual you wish to credit.

```
git commit -m "Regular ol' commit
>
>
Co-authored-by: your-name <your-email@your-domain.com>
Co-authored-by: their-name <their-email@their-domain.com>"
```

----
## Branching with Git
Branches allow developers to work on different features without affecting the master branch. Below are instructions to make a branch, switch to it, commit changes and merge with master. 

```
git branch feature-branch
git checkout feature-branch

git add .
git commit â€“m "a commit message"

git checkout master
git merge feature-branch
```

----
## Set the date of the last commit
Set the date and time of the last commit without editing the messge. 
```Python
git commit --amend --no-edit --date "Mon 29 Apr 2019 09:47:53 -0400"
```

## Squash commits already pushed to GitHub
This squash the last N commits by rebasing and force pushing to GitHub avoiding this helpful but unwanted error.
```
To https://github.com/LameLemon/pepe-is-the-man.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/LameLemon/pepe-is-the-man.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

First, through interactive rebasing set the HEAD back to the number of commits you want to squash.
```
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

In the text editor pick on commit to go with and squash the others.
```
pick 2871a3f adding the dankest pepe
squash ba1834f adding the second dankest pepe
squash 13ed324 adding the third dankest pepe

# Rebase 13ed324..2871a3f onto 9482e8a
#
# Commands:
#  p, pick = use commit
#  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
#  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
```

Save and exit and on the next text file comment (#) everything except what you want the new commit message to be. Then save and exit again. Now the commits have been squashed.

Now force push the changes to the desired branch. 

```
git push origin +master
```

----
## Keep a fork up to date
First after cloning the repository make sure to add the original repository as 'upstream', this only needs to be done once.
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/GITHUB-USER/ORIGNIAL-REPO.git
```

Now everytime you need to update your local copy with changes from the original you need to do the following three steps.
Fristfetch the changes from the upstream repository.
```
git fetch upstream
```

Checkout your local master branch and merge with the upstream master.
```
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
```

You can then push the changes to your GitHub fork.
```
git push
```
