This is a web game contains four unique levels, all increasing in difficulty. The main aim of the game is to shoot down the enemy vehicles before they escape you shoot you down first. After the end of each level, the user's progress is saved so the game can be continued at another time.

Crime Hunter started out as a class group project where I was a developer and graphic designer.

The game was built using JavaScript and [Phaser.js](https://phaser.io/), which is an open source game framework based on Canvas and WebGL. We took the game as a learning opportunity since it was the first time anyone in our team worked with JavaScript or Phaser before. The project presented a lot of noteworthy challenges from building a simple AI for the non-player characters, incorporating graphics into a game while optimising for the efficient use of resources and providing consistency between browsers.
