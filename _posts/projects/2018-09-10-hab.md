The [high altitude weather balloon](https://sites.google.com/ubseds.org/home/projects/weather-balloon?authuser=0) is currently under works. The complete project will contain various sensors recording temperature, humidity, altitude and atmospheric pressure. Alongside these sensors will be a GPS module keeping track of the co-ordinates of the balloon. This data will be stored on an SD Card for use after the retrieval. During flight the balloon will be able to transmit packets of information using APRS (Automatic Packet Reporting System), so that we can track it's recording and location from the ground. While the balloon descends a buzzer will sound along with an LED to make retrieval easier. In the event the HAB is stuck in a tree, we will be able to trigger the release mechanism from the ground. This will heat the nichrome wire releasing the payload from the balloon allowing the data to be retrieved.

The project is part of the UB SEDS (University at Buffalo Students for the Exploration and Development of Space) High Altitude Weather Balloon team, with members from various science and engineering departments.
