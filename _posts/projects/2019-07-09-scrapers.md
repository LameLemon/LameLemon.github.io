Web scraping is the act of extracting data from websites. This is a repository of scrapers I've built over the years for various websites. They download media files and other data. These scripts exist purely for education purposes. 

The scrapers are built using Python 3 and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) which is a library for grabbing and navigating data from HTML and XML files.
